# This is my report file for this project
------------------------------------------------------------
Report 1:        Date - 5/6/2020
------------------------------------------------------------
## This report is for 2nd presentation of the project which was held on 4/6/2020
------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics discussed
- how the project is distrubuted
- what algorithms have we choosen for face detection and person tracking
- what is your progress on the project

## Questions asked
- what is the equation of neuron in CNN?
- why do we need activation funcitons in CNN?
- what is activation function?
- what is optimiser?
- which algorithm have we selected for the person tracking ?

## Our project progress 
- we have got the dataset for training the gender detection model.
- we have tried Haar Cascasce model for face detection,but accuracy is low for large images.

## Conclusion 
- We need to increase our speed, we are lagging behind by a week.
- We need to study different algorithms or model available for face deteciton and person tracking and then compare them and find the best fitting model for this project.
- We need to study concepts behind CNN in more detail.
